        "\n",
        "**Goal:** To ensure our application can handle increasing user traffic and data volume without significant performance degradation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metrics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Latency:** Average response time for requests. We aim to keep it below a certain threshold (e.g., 200ms).\n",
        "* **Throughput:** Number of requests served per second or minute. We want to maximize this while maintaining acceptable latency.\n",
        "* **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, and network utilization. We aim to optimize resource usage to avoid bottlenecks.\n",
        "* **Error Rate:** Percentage of requests that fail due to errors. We want to keep this as close to 0% as possible.\n",
        "* **Scalability:** The ability to easily increase resources and capacity to handle increased load.\n",
        "* **Availability:** The percentage of time the application is available to users. We aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9%).\n",
        "* **Cost:** The cost of running the application, including infrastructure, maintenance, and operational costs. We want to optimize for cost-effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Goal:** Reduce average response time for user logins to under 100ms.\n",
        "* **Goal:** Increase the number of concurrent users handled by the system from 1000 to 10000.\n",
        "* **Goal:** Ensure the application remains available even during peak traffic hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These scaling goals and metrics can be tailored to the specific needs and context of your application. By defining them clearly, you can create a roadmap for scaling your application effectively and efficiently.\n"
